# Channels-Discord

**Django Channels Discord** is a bridge between Discord (specifically, the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) Python library) and Django's [channels](https://github.com/django/channels).  It contains both a new interface server for connecting to Discord and Channels consumers -- everything you need to turn your Django app into an Discord chatbot, chat monitoring/moderating service, or whatever else you might use a real-time Discord client to do.
